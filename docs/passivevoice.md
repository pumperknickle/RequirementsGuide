## Use Active Voice over Passive Voice

Use the active voice in the main sentence structure of the need or requirement statement with the responsible entity clearly identified as the subject of the sentence.

> The active voice requires that the entity performing the action is the subject of the sentence. This is important in writing needs and requirements since the onus for satisfying the requirement is on the subject, not the object of the statement. If the entity responsible for the action is not identified explicitly, it is unclear who or what should perform the action making verification of that requirement very difficulty.
