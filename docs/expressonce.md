## Express Once

Express each need and requirement once and only once.

> Avoid including the same or equivalent need and requirement more than once, either as a duplicate or in similar form.

Exact duplicates can be found by matching of text strings. The main problem is to identify similarities with different
expressions yet are equivalent. For example: "The system shall generate a report of financial transactions containing
the information defined in <some standard or contract deliverable listing>" and "The system shall generate a financial
report" are overlapping in that the first is a subset of the second.
