## Consistent Terms

Use each term and units of measure consistently throughout need and requirement sets.

> Terms and units of measure must be used consistently throughout not only the sets of needs and requirements, but all
artifacts developed across all life cycle stages.

#### Unacceptable

- When the Input_Valve is connected to the Water_Source, the Control_Subsystem shall open the Inlet_Valve.

- It would not be acceptable for one requirement to use one unit of measure (e.g. US - feet) and another to use another
unit of measure (e.g. Metric - meter).

#### Acceptable

- Settle on only one term, define it in the glossary, and then use it consistently in each need, requirement, and design
output artifact.

- When the Inlet_Valve is connected to the Water_Source, the Control_Subsystem shall open the Inlet_Valve.
