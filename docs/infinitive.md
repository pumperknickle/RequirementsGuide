## Avoid Superfluous Infinitives

> Avoid writing requirements with more verbs than necessary to describe a basic action. Requirements containing superfluous infinitives can cause problems in verification. It can be argued that a system meets a requirement ‘to be capable of’ or ‘to be able to’ deliver some result – even if it fails frequently – so long as it delivers that result some of the time.

#### Examples

- be able to
- be capable of
- be designed to

#### Unacceptable

- The weapon system shall be able to store the location of each ordnance.

#### Acceptable

- The weapon system shall store the location of each ordnance.
