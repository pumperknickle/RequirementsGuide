## Avoid Vague Universals

Use "each" instead of "all", "any", or "both" when universal quantification is intended

> The use of "all", "both", or "any" is confusing because it is hard to distinguish whether the action happens to the whole set or to each element of the set. "All" can also be hard to verify unless "all" can be clearly defined as a closed set.

#### Examples

- all
- any
- both

#### Unacceptable

- The logger shall record any (or all) warning messages.
- The system shall display the names of both the items.

#### Acceptable

- The logger shall record each message.
- The system shall display the name of each item.
