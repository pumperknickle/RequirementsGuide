## Define Temporal Dependencies Explicitly

Define temporal dependencies explicitly instead of using indefinite temporal keywords.

> Words and phrases that signal non-specific timing are ambiguous and not verifiable. Indefinite temporal keywords can cause confusion or unintended meaning. These words should be replaced by specific timing constraints.

#### Examples

- eventually
- until
- before
- when
- after
- as
- once
- earliest
- latest
- instantaneous
- simultaneous
- while
- at last

#### Unacceptable

- Continual operation of the pump shall eventually result in the tank being empty.

#### Acceptable

- The pump shall remove greater than 99% of the fluid from the tank in less than 3 days of continuous operation.
