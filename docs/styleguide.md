## Style Guide

Use a project-wide style guide for individual need and requirement statements.

> The style guide provides a template and patterns for developing requirements, defines the attributes that the
organization chooses to document with each requirement statement, selects the requirement patterns to be used for
specific types of requirements, and defines what other information needs to be included (such as the glossary).

#### Example:

Each organization should have a style guide or schema to address such issues as the selection and definition of what
need and requirement patterns should be used for writing needs and requirements of a particular type, the selection and
use of attributes, standard abbreviations and acronyms, layout and use of figures and tables, layout of needs and
requirements documents or databases and, need and requirement statement numbering.

Terms used throughout the sets of needs and requirements are defined in an ontology or at least a project glossary.
