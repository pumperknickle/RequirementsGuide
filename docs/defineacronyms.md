## Define Acronyms

If acronyms are used in need and requirement statements, use a consistent set of acronyms.

> The same acronym must be used in each need and requirement; various versions of the acronym are not acceptable.

#### Unacceptable

- It would not be acceptable for one requirement to use the acronym "CP" for command post and another acronym "CMDP"
to also refer to the "command post".

- It would not be acceptable for one requirement to refer to the "Global Positioning System" and the remaining
requirements refer just to "GPS".

#### Acceptable

- Settle on only one acronym, define it in the list of acronyms, and then use it consistently throughout the requirement
set.

- Use the full term every time or, perhaps more usefully, define the acronym in the acronym list or glossary and use it
every time.
