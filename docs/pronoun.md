## Avoid Pronouns

Avoid the use of pronouns and indefinite pronouns.

> When writing stories, pronouns are a useful device for avoiding the repetition of nouns; but when writing need and requirement statements, pronouns are effectively cross-references to nouns in other need or requirement statements and, as such, are ambiguous and should be avoided. Repeat nouns in full isntead of using pronouns to refer to nouns in other need or requirement statements.
