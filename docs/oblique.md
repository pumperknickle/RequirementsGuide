## Avoid Obliques

Avoid the use of the oblique ("/") symbol.

> The oblique symbol ("/") or "slash", has so many possible meanings that it should be avoided. The slash symbol can lead to amibuous need or requirement statements that do not reflect accurately the true customer needs or concept from which the needs are derived. An exception to this rule is where the oblique symbol is used in units.
